# 🥕 HopHop 🐇

A bash-script to set up fresh Arch(based) systems.

This is a fork of Typecraft's [Crucible](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/crucible)

## What it does 

The main script updates the system, sets up the AUR and yay. It then installs the packages sourced from the packages.conf file. The specified packages are tailored to my needs.
Additionally there is a script that installs flatpaks and a script that downloads and applies the dotfiles from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/PEEK2000/dotfiles) repo.

## Prerequisites

- Internet
- Arch based distro
- sudo privileges
