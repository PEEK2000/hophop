# HopHop 🐇

A bash-script to set up new Arch(based) systems.

This is a fork of Typecraft's [Crucible](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/crucible)

## What it does

The main script updates the system, sets up the AUR and yay and installs the packages sourced from the packages.conf file. The specified packages are tailored to my needs.
Additionally there is a script that installs flatpaks and a script to download and apply the dotfiles from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/PEEK2000/dotfiles) repo.

## Prerequisites

- Internet
- Arch based distro
- sudo privileges
